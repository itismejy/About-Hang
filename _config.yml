title: About Hang
description: Hang makes it easy to create and organize events with your friends spontaneously. By displaying the important event details (time, date, location, who is attending) in a user-friendly way, we save time for you and the host. With a built-in convenient chatroom centered around the event themselves, we eliminate the countless group-chats you used to make for each sub-set of the friend circle. Want to Hang with your friends? No problem, the built-in share feature lets you send the event to your friends through other social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc). Friends can also quickly and easily Hang with just a 5 digit event code. IOS and Android Integration
